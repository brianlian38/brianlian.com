                &nbsp;studying Computer Science + Business. I'm currently working on a project aggregating polticial data, building cool things at a data startup, and 
                solving problems at a digital bank.
                I was previously at a series B startup called

                Ever since I was young, I've been curious about how to best make the lives of those around me better! Driven by this passion, 
                I have found that I love to tackle the problems others face head-on - specifically by building solutions. To this end, I‚Äôve grown experiences in product, 
                data science, full stack, and business. Dually user focused and data driven, I am always trying to grow and apply my toolkit - see for yourself!
              
                I also love to build up my community around me. I am a board director and former co-chair of&nbsp;

                I thoroughly enjoy contributing to the growth of Toronto's tech scene through challenging like-minded individuals.

                You should know that I am a <b>huge</b> stathead. So much so, that I have been tracking my own daily statistics - inspired by

                This journey has allowed me to enrich my experience of life through gleaned insights. Check out

                Aside from my crazy self-stats journey, I've also applied my skills to try to win NBA fantasy league every season - focusing on advanced analytics. This interest 
                has since expanded to the political sphere as well. Its why publications like
